# happ-cli

**English** | [Русский](README.ru.md)

A terminal VPN client compatible with [HAPP](https://happ.su) subscription
profiles. It fetches a subscription, parses its share links
(VLESS / VMess / Trojan / Shadowsocks), and connects through an embedded
[xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) — as a local proxy, a system
proxy, or a full system-wide TUN tunnel.

Single self-contained binary: xray-core and tun2socks are embedded, no external
binaries required.

## Features

- **HAPP-compatible** subscriptions: a subscription URL returns a base64 list of
  share links, and the metadata headers HAPP clients understand are read:
  `subscription-userinfo` (traffic/expiry), `profile-title`,
  `profile-update-interval`, `support-url`. Requests are sent with
  `User-Agent: Happ/1.0` so panels return the format HAPP expects (overridable
  with `--ua`).
- **Protocols**: VLESS (incl. Reality / XTLS Vision), VMess, Trojan,
  Shadowsocks. **Transports**: TCP, WebSocket, gRPC, HTTP/2. **Security**: TLS,
  Reality.
- **Three ways to route traffic**:
  - `connect` — local SOCKS5 + HTTP proxy on `127.0.0.1` (no root);
  - `connect --system-proxy` — sets the macOS system SOCKS + HTTP/HTTPS proxy
    (needs `sudo`), so browsers and most apps go through it without touching the
    routing table — coexists with another active VPN;
  - `connect --mode tun` — full system-wide VPN via a utun device (needs `sudo`).

> **Note**: xray-core cannot dial Hysteria2 / TUIC / WireGuard outbounds. Such
> servers are still parsed and listed (marked `unsupported`), but you cannot
> connect to them through xray (a sing-box based core would be required).

## How it works

```
subscription URL
      │  profile.Fetch (User-Agent: Happ/1.0)
      ▼
base64 list of links ──► link.Parse ──► []link.Server
                                            │ xray.BuildConfig
                                            ▼
                                    xray-core config (JSON)
                                            │ xray.Start (embedded core)
              ┌─────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┐
              ▼                             ▼                             ▼
      proxy: SOCKS5/HTTP          --system-proxy: networksetup     tun: tun2socks
      on 127.0.0.1                sets system SOCKS/HTTP            + route table
      (no root)                   (sudo)                           (sudo, utun)
```

## Install

### mise (recommended)

Prebuilt binaries are published to GitHub Releases. Install with
[mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) — no Go toolchain required. The binary inside the
archive is `happ` (not `happ-cli`), so pass `exe=happ`:

```sh
mise use -g "github:aimuzov/happ-cli[exe=happ]@latest"
```

or pin it in `mise.toml`:

```toml
[tools]
"github:aimuzov/happ-cli" = { version = "latest", exe = "happ" }
```

The `ubi` backend works the same way against the same releases, if you prefer it:
`ubi:aimuzov/happ-cli[exe=happ]`.

> For frequent installs, set `MISE_GITHUB_TOKEN` (or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) to avoid
> GitHub API rate limits.

### Manual download

Download the archive for your OS/arch from the
[Releases](https://github.com/aimuzov/happ-cli/releases) page, extract it, and
put the `happ` binary on your `PATH`.

### From source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aimuzov/happ-cli
cd happ-cli
go build -o happ .   # requires Go 1.26+
```

The resulting `happ` binary is self-contained.

> **`go install github.com/aimuzov/happ-cli@latest` does not work.** The build
> relies on a `replace` directive in `go.mod` (to reconcile xray-core and
> tun2socks on gvisor), and `go install pkg@version` ignores `replace`. Use a
> prebuilt binary or clone and build.

## Usage

### Subscriptions

```sh
happ sub add https://panel.example/sub/TOKEN --name myvpn   # add (becomes active)
happ sub list                                               # list subscriptions
happ sub update [name]                                      # re-fetch (default: active)
happ sub use <name>                                         # set the active subscription
happ sub rm <name>                                          # remove
```

`sub list` shows traffic and expiry from the subscription headers:

```
ACTIVE  NAME    TITLE       SERVERS  TRAFFIC          EXPIRES
*       myvpn   My VPN      12       12.4 GB / 200 GB  2026-09-01
```

### Servers

```sh
happ list           # servers in the active subscription
happ list --sub x   # servers in a specific subscription
```

```
#  PROTOCOL                 ADDRESS              TAG
1  vless                    de.example:443       🇩🇪 Germany
2  trojan                   nl.example:443       🇳🇱 Netherlands
3  hysteria2 (unsupported)  hy.example:443       Fast HY2
```

### Connecting

`connect` runs in the foreground until interrupted with `Ctrl+C`. The `selector`
picks a server: empty = first, a number = 1-based index from `happ list`, or a
case-insensitive substring of the server tag.

```sh
happ connect                 # first server, proxy mode
happ connect 2               # server #2
happ connect germany         # first server whose tag matches "germany"

sudo happ connect 1 --system-proxy   # browsers/apps via system proxy (no routing changes)
sudo happ connect 1 --mode tun       # full system-wide VPN
```

In plain proxy mode, point apps at `socks5://127.0.0.1:10808` (Firefox: enable
"Proxy DNS when using SOCKS v5").

### `connect` flags

| Flag             | Default | Description                                         |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `-m, --mode`     | `proxy` | `proxy` or `tun`                                    |
| `--socks`        | `10808` | local SOCKS5 port                                   |
| `--http`         | `10809` | local HTTP proxy port (proxy mode)                  |
| `--system-proxy` | `false` | set the macOS system proxy (proxy mode, needs sudo) |
| `--sub`          | active  | subscription name                                   |
| `--bypass`       | `ru`    | route a region's traffic direct: `ru` or `off`      |

### Three ways to route traffic, compared

- **`connect` (proxy)** — only apps explicitly pointed at
  `socks5://127.0.0.1:10808` (e.g. Firefox with remote DNS). No root.
- **`connect --system-proxy`** — sets, on every enabled network service, the
  system SOCKS (`--socks` port) and HTTP/HTTPS (`--http` port) proxies, so
  Safari/Chrome and apps that ignore SOCKS go through the proxy. Does **not**
  touch the routing table, so it **coexists with another active VPN**. Needs
  `sudo`; the previous proxy settings are restored on exit. If a session was
  killed (`kill -9`) and the proxy stuck, reset it with
  `sudo happ system-proxy off`.
- **`connect --mode tun`** — a full system VPN via a utun device; captures all
  traffic. Needs `sudo`. If another VPN is active at the same time, disconnect it
  first so the tunnels don't fight over routes/DNS.

### Bypassing Russian traffic

By default happ routes Russian domains and IP ranges (`geosite:category-ru`,
`geoip:ru`) straight out, outside the tunnel, so sites that block foreign VPNs
(e.g. `ozon.ru`) keep working. The first connect downloads the `geoip.dat` and
`geosite.dat` databases from
[Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat](https://github.com/Loyalsoldier/v2ray-rules-dat)
into `<config>/geo/` and refreshes them once a day. Bypass applies in both proxy
and tun modes.

```sh
happ connect --bypass off    # route everything through the tunnel (one run)
happ connect --bypass ru     # force RU bypass (one run)

happ route                   # show the active subscription's bypass setting
happ route set off           # persist: send all traffic through the tunnel
happ route set ru            # persist: bypass Russian traffic (default)
happ route update            # force-refresh the geo databases
```

The `--bypass` flag overrides the stored setting for a single run; `route set`
changes the stored default per subscription. If the databases can't be
downloaded while bypass is enabled, connect fails with an explanatory error
rather than silently sending RU traffic through the tunnel — retry with a
network connection or use `--bypass off`.

### Other commands

```sh
happ config [selector]       # print the generated xray-core config (debug)
happ system-proxy off        # emergency reset of the system proxy (sudo)
```

## Configuration & storage

State (subscriptions and cached links) is stored as `state.json` in the
per-user config directory (`~/Library/Application Support/happ-cli` on macOS),
overridable with the global `--home` flag.

## TUN mode details (macOS)

1. the server address is resolved to IP(s), and a host route to each is pinned to
   its current next hop (a physical gateway, or an already-active VPN interface),
   so the proxy's own connection to the server does not loop back into the tunnel;
2. a `utun` device is created and tun2socks forwards its traffic to the local
   SOCKS proxy served by xray;
3. the default route is overridden with two `/1` routes scoped to the utun device
   (the real default route is left intact for a clean teardown);
4. global IPv6 is routed into `lo0` (blocked), so IPv6-capable sites
   (Google, YouTube) don't leak outside the tunnel — apps fall back to IPv4
   through the tunnel; link-local IPv6 keeps working via its more-specific route;
5. on `Ctrl+C` all routes are removed in reverse order.

## Limitations

- **Hysteria2 / TUIC / WireGuard** cannot be dialed by xray-core (they are parsed
  and listed as `unsupported`). Most HAPP profiles are VLESS-Reality and work
  fully.
- **TUN and `--system-proxy` are macOS-only** in this version.
- **IPv6 is blocked in TUN mode** (the proxy path is IPv4); IPv6-only
  destinations become unreachable while connected.
- `connect` runs in the **foreground**; there is no background daemon yet.
- A `kill -9` skips cleanup: a system proxy stays set (`sudo happ system-proxy
off`) and TUN IPv6-block routes remain (`sudo route -n delete -inet6 -net
::/1; sudo route -n delete -inet6 -net 8000::/1`). A normal `Ctrl+C` cleans up.

## Project layout

| Package             | Responsibility                                              |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `internal/link`     | parse share links (vless/vmess/trojan/ss/hysteria2)         |
| `internal/profile`  | fetch a subscription, decode the base64 list + headers      |
| `internal/xray`     | build xray-core config from a server, run the embedded core |
| `internal/tunnel`   | TUN mode: tun2socks + macOS route management                |
| `internal/sysproxy` | macOS system proxy via networksetup                         |
| `internal/store`    | persist subscriptions and cached links                      |
| `internal/cli`      | cobra commands                                              |

## Development

```sh
go test ./...        # unit tests + a real end-to-end proxy test
go vet ./...
```

The xray integration test starts a real Shadowsocks server and a client built
from a `link.Server`, then verifies an HTTP request routed through the client's
SOCKS inbound reaches a target through the proxy.

> xray-core and tun2socks require different `gvisor.dev/gvisor` versions; a
> `replace` directive in `go.mod` pins gvisor to the version both build against.
> Don't drop it — see the comment there.

### Releasing

Releases are built by [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) in CI on a tag push:

```sh
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
```

The `release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) builds darwin/linux
binaries for amd64/arm64 and uploads them to GitHub Releases. Building there
honors the `go.mod` `replace` directive (happ-cli is the main module). Dry-run
locally with `goreleaser release --clean --snapshot`.
